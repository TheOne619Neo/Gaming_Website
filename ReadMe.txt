Attached in the folder you will find a resource folder.
Inside the folder find 3 other folders, Lato, OndoFontCompressed and HTML.
You are to focus on the HTML Folder.

The website is coded in HTML,CSS & Javascript.

To run and view the website, run index.html on VScode and implement Live Server or use any other relevant methods.

To go through the code that built the website you can view index.html or styles.css or script.js.

Any left out details could be added provided there was slightly more time, note comments for where missing style details.
